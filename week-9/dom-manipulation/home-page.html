  I worked on this challenge with Jason Milfred.
  This challenge took me 2.75 hours including prep work.


- What did you learn about the DOM?

  I learned that the DOM is a big tree that includes nodes and leaves for all the elements on a web page.
  Using built-in JavaScript methods, you can access all of the nodes and leaves and manipulate and change
  them dynamically, altering a web page after it's been displayed.

- What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

  document.getElementById - get the element on the page with the given id.
  document.getElementsByTagName - get an array of all elements that have a given tag.
  Node.childNodes - get an array of all child elements of the node.
  Node.firstChild - get the first child of the node.
  Node.lastChild - get the last child of the node.
  Node.parent - get the parent of the node.
  Node.nextSibling - get the next child of your parent node
  Node.previousSibling - get the previous child of your parent node
