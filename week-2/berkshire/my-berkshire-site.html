<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was very cool!  Especially from a live site like Berkshire Hathaway.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I liked reading more about the difference between older table-driven positioning and newer div-based positioning.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Very good, we weren't tempted to use formatting at all for the basic HTML skeleton, other than the very simple top level formatting.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

Good: it's very powerful and expressive as far as formatting goes.
Medium: layout and positioning can either be clunky or a little hard to grasp or keep track of.
Annoying: Seemingly inconsistent rules on self-closing tags.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Write a lot of it.
Keep writing it.
Remembering that it's hierarchical - it's easier to keep a hierarchy in mind.
