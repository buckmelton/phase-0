# acct_groups(names)
#
# I worked on this by myself.
# I spent 2 hours on this challenge.
#
# Input:
# An array of names
#
# Output:
# A hash of arrays, each hash entry having a key that is the name of the Accountability
# Group e.g. "Accountability Group 1", and the value being an array of the names of the
# members of that group.  Each group should have ideally 4 or 5 members, and minimally 3.
#
# Pseudocode:
#
# Create a collection of indexed collections. Each inner collection will hold the names
# of one group.  The number of inner
# collections should be the number of names / 4. (This will ensure that
# every group will have at least 4 members, with some groups potentially
# having 5.)
#
# "Deal out" the names to the inner collections created above:
# Loop through each name in the input name list
#    Add name to the collection with the index of the name mod the number of collections
#   (E.g. if the name's index is 21 and the number of collections is 16, add this name
#    to group 5)
#
# Create a new collection, each entry will contain the name of the group,
# and the names of the group members
# Loop through the groups of names, for each group of names:
# 	Put an entry in the collection that consists of the name of the group, and the group
# 	member names
#
# Return the collection of group names/members
#

# Reflection:

# - What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?

# 	The most interesting part was figuring out how to apportion names to groups.
# 	The most difficult part was discovering the correct syntax to initialize an array of empty arrays.

# - Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?

# 	Yes.

# - Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?

# 	I thought it was a great solution.

# 	What could have made it better would be to put 5 people in each group,
# 	without having any group with 6 people.  If I used the same heuristic, that would have
# 	required some extra post-processing because my current solution, if made for 5 people
# 	instead of 4, could have put 6 people into some groups, and those groups would need to be
# 	made smaller somehow.

# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?

# 	I originally used just an array of arrays, where each inner array represented
# 	one group and contained the names in that group.  But then the actual group name
# 	wasn't represented anywhere, so I decided to make it a hash, where the key is the
# 	group name and the value is the array of student names.

# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?

# 	I became more comfortable working with hashes.  I'd heard that hashes in
# 	Ruby now are ordered according to the order they were entered, so I took
# 	advantage of that for the first time to help name the Accountability Groups
# 	with a number, the number being their index in the hash.
