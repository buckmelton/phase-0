	      	<p>
			This week I've learned a bit about the command line and become more familiar with Git and GitHub. Now I'm going to write a blog to introduce these concepts to other beginners. In this post I'll be addressing:<br/><br/>

			- What are the benefits of version control?<br/>
			- How does git help you keep track of changes?<br/>
			- Why use GitHub to store your code?<br/>

			<ul>
			  <li>What are the benefits of version control?<br/><br/>
			    Version control allows you to encapsulate and track changes made to code.  In the event of a bug or unwanted behavior, this allows you to determine the cause by easily examining the differences in previous versions of the code and who made what changes when.  Whether or not you find the cause of the unwanted behavior, you can roll back the code to a previous known working point and proceed forward again from there.  Without version control, it would be extremely difficult or impossible to remember or find where all the various code changes were made in order to easily pinpoint when a problem was introduced, and it would likely be impossible (beyond a trivial change) to roll the code back to a known working point.<br/><br/>
			  </li>
			  <li>How does git help you keep track of changes?<br/><br/>
			    Git helps keep track of changes by allowing developers to work in separate copies ("branches") of the entire code base and to atomically merge those branches back into the master branch.  Git tracks all the changes that were made so the changes by a developer are encapsulated into a known change point, and can be rolled back if the changes cause a bug or unwanted behavior.  Git also allows you to inspect and easily see the differences between different save points of the code base.<br/><br/>
			  </li>
			  <li>Why use GitHub to store your code?<br/><br/>
			    There are two crucial reasons for using GitHub to store your code.  First, GitHub, being in the cloud, allows developers to easily collaborate on a single repository, since each developer can easily download ("pull") the entire code base from GitHub to their local computer, work on it separately there, and merge their changes in a tightly controlled fashion back into the shared main ("master") code base.  Second, GitHub provides a convenient remote backup for your local files.<br/><br/>

			<h2>How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?</h2>
			<p>It was actually fun and inspiring to co-work on a mock-up.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?</h2>
			<p>Yes definitely. The wireframe helped to thing in larger skeleton-blocks of code (navigation, article, footer etc) before detailing it down later on. I have the impression that without a mock-up, we would have had the tendency to dive into the code straight away and get lost in desorganisation.</p>

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	- We have hused article to describe each of our distinct blogposts.
	- We often used sections as there are multiple sections per article.
	- We didn't use any nav, figure or figcaption as there were none in our individual blogposts.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	The elements follow the html file by structure (top down and left-right)

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	I already used the html snippet (probably by accident), but this looks like a very helpful function to save time. Especially when creating similar pages with a large portion of the same code. For example I gues that I could add my blog template as a snippet so that all future blogposts have the right structure, links to css files etc. 
	I defenitely use as much shortcuts as possible to save time. After all it takes a couple of minutes to learn them and it saves much more time in the long run!

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	We used the HTML5 tags 'section' and 'article' in this challenge.  I hadn't previously used 'article', since I'm still getting familiar with all of the various semantic tags and their best uses.  I've often used 'section', since it's a top-level, very generic tag, comparable to 'div', and extremely useful when slicing up your HTML page into constituent elements.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	We didn't really discuss this as part of this challenge.  However, typically CSS is used to determine position on the page.  The general rule, even before CSS is taken into account, is that the top-level elements are laid out left-to-right and top-to-bottom.  And then within each element, its subelements are recursively laid out thusly.  However, that can be altered depending on how CSS is used to style the elements.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	I learned that you can easily create customized snippets to quickly insert whole formatted blocks of code or text that you use often.  I will definitely be creating some snippets!  I'm also very curious about what existing snippets there may be.  I'm sure there's a whole universe of ones already created, it's juat a matter of finding which if any are relevant to my uses.
